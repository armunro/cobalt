##What?
Cobalt is an automation framework that seeks to make automation pipelines: Simple, Descriptive and Accessible.  
##Why?
Automation/ETL pipelines are commonplace in larger information processing applications. However, these software systems are almost exclusively limited to large enterprise use or are developer-made solutions. When such powerful automatition exists, it should be accessable, for everyone.
##How?
- Rules/Specifications - Formalized and documentable rules about how information should be directed
- Actions - Send a request, create a file, insert a record.
- Interactions - Do something with c
- Standard Interaction Language
