###Interactions
Several different types of interactions exist to acomplish different goals. They are as follows:

- StructuralInteractions: Alters the shape/formatting of the Cobalt Data 
- FactualInteractions: Alters the values (facts) in the persistant data structure
- LogicalInteractions: Rules define standardized decisions that can made manually, automatically or both.
- IterativeInteractions: Loop over collections and feed nested/linked pipelines  
- ExecutableInteractions: Do something completely different like print a page. Either a human or a computer can do this. This may start off as a manual task for a human, but become an automated task as development of techology allows.

###InteractionPlans
Interaction plans can be described as the 'checklists' that dictate what interactions should be done. InteractionsPlans consist of:
- Sequential _or_ heirarchical list of interactions
- Failure plans (paths to take if an interaction or plan fails)
- Possible failure mitigation
- Failure detection -> response
